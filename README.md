# AndroidForumApp
Forum app for android devices, written in Java as a school project.

My final high school project worth 5 units in the Bagrut.

Users can upload and view text posts in the main screen (similar to twitter).
Data is saved locally using SQLite (local database was mandatory for the Bagrut, hosting the database on a cloud can be implemented for true online forum experience).

*App was designed for the pixel 3a XL, smaller-sized devices may have design issues.
